Xacobeo
=======

This CPAN package provides a simple GUI for building and running XPath queries.
It consists of a graphical user interface which shows the content of an XML
document and allows the user to write and execute arbitrary XPath queries. Once
a query has been executed its results are displayed in the application.

The main goal of this program is to provide a view of the XML document as an XML
parser sees it. Thus, each element and attribute is prefixed with a namespace
if the node uses one in the original document, this is no matter if in the
original document it was declared with a default namespace, if it inherited the
parent's namespace or if it was using a prefix.

The program registers automatically the namespaces declared in the document.
This allows the XPath expressions to use namespaces automatically without any
configuration.

PROJECT

The project is now hosted on github (http://github.com/potyl/xacobeo/) which
provides the latest source code and a simple bug tracking.

Even tough github provides a download facility, the project's source code
bundles will always be published through CPAN. It's easier this way for the
project and after all this is a Perl project!

BUGS

Please when possible try to submit the bugs through the github issue tracker
(http://github.com/potyl/xacobeo/issues) otherwise simply create a ticket
through RT.
