Xacobeo
=======

This CPAN package provides a simple GUI for building and running XPath queries.
It consists of a graphical user interface which shows the content of an XML
document and allows the user to write and execute arbitrary XPath queries. Once
a query has been executed its results are displayed in the application.

The main goal of this program is to provide a view of the XML document as an XML
parser sees it. Thus, each element and attribute is prefixed with a namespace
if the node uses one in the original document, this is no matter if in the
original document it was declared with a default namespace, if it inherited the
parent's namespace or if it was using a prefix.

The program registers automatically the namespaces declared in the document.
This allows the XPath expressions to use namespaces automatically without any
configuration.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

PROJECT

The project is now hosted on github (http://github.com/potyl/xacobeo/) which
provides the latest source code and a simple bug tracking.

Even tough github provides a download facility, the project's source code
bundles will always be published through CPAN. It's easier this way for the
project and after all this is a Perl project!

BUGS

Please when possible try to submit the bugs through the github issue tracker
(http://github.com/potyl/xacobeo/issues) otherwise simply create a ticket
through RT.
